      <p>I got my first taste of this creamy caramel in Chile.<br/> Knowing I couldn't buy it where I live in the United States,<br/> I practiced with trial and error until I found this lovely recipe.<br/> Use as a spread on toast or rolls, add to brownie recipes,<br/> sandwich between sugar cookies, stir into coffee, or <br/>find your own way to enjoy this creamy Latin American caramel!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 gallon whole milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li> 4 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons water</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, sugar, sweetener, and vanilla in the biggest pot you have.<br/> Place over medium heat and stir until sugar dissolves. <br/>Increase heat and bring to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>As soon as it boils, combine water and baking soda in a small bowl and <br/>stir to dissolve; don't worry if it doesn't dissolve completely.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from the stove and place in the sink. Add baking soda mixture and <br/>stir vigorously as milk will expand rapidly-be prepared!<br/> When the mixture returns to its original volume, return the pot to the stove and bring <br/>to a very brisk simmer. It may concern you that it will scorch,<br/> but it should be practically boiling. Cook, checking and stirring occasionally, <br/>until it turns a deep golden brown, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>After the mixture has turned dark caramel in color, check it more frequently.<br/> The longer you cook it after the color change, the thicker it will be.<br/> For a consistency similar to caramel, cook for another 15 minutes. <br/>For a thicker, spreadable consistency, cook for another 20 to 25 minutes.<br/> For a candy-like consistency, cook it even longer. Just remember that <br/>it will thicken up tremendously after cooling.</li>
        <li>Once you're ready, pour the caramel into a plastic container with a lid, or pour into jars.<br/>. It can be kept without refrigeration, but with refrigeration <br/>it is good for many weeks.</li>
      </ol>
