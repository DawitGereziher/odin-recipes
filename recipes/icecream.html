     <p>Once you learn the basics, you can turn out your own small-batch artisanal frozen desserts<br/> (you could totally call it that) in any flavor imaginable.<br/> Get ready, here's how to make ice cream at home.</p>
     <h2>Types of Ice Cream</h2>
     <p>Homemade ice cream comes in two basic styles:<br/>
        Custard-style (also called French) and Philadelphia-style (also called New York or American).</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Custard-style ice cream starts with a cooked base enriched with egg yolks, sugar, and cream. <br/>This style of ice cream has the smoothest, creamiest, richest texture and flavor.</li>
         <li>Philadelphia-style ice cream contains no eggs, eliminating the need to cook a base. <br/>The texture is lighter and more delicate than custard-style ice cream.<br/> It's also faster to make because there's no cooked base to cool before churning, <br/>although you do want to make sure the mixture is quite cold before it hits the ice cream machine.</li>
        </ul>
     <h2>What Do You Need to Make Homemade Ice Cream?</h2> 
     <ul>
        <li>8 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 cups half-and-half</li>
        <li>Pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
     </ul>  
     <h2>Directions</h2>
     <ol>
        <li> In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and half of the sugar. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, stir together the cream, half-and-half, salt, and remaining sugar.<br/> Heat the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring often, until it comes to a simmer, <br/>then reduce heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/2 cup of the cream mixture to the egg mixture while whisking constantly <br/>(this helps prevent the eggs from cooking). Repeat with another 1/2 cup of the cream mixture.</li>
        <li>Using a heatproof spatula, stir the cream mixture in the saucepan <br/>constantly as you pour the egg mixture into the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and mixture coats the back of the spatula,<br/> 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl and whisk in the vanilla extract.<br/> Set the bowl in an ice bath and stir the base occasionally <br/>until it's cooled to room temperature. Remove the bowl from the ice bath, cover with plastic <br/>wrap, and refrigerate at least 2 to 4 hours or overnight before churning, either in an ice cream machine or by hand<br/> (see below for tips on how to churn ice cream).</li>
